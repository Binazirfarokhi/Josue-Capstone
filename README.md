# Josue-Capstone
Week 01 Capstone Project 
Review the past projects on our news page to get ideas, as you will have to form a team today and start coming up with three possible ideas for this term project. It is essential to consider what mobile-specific technologies you can use in your project - this is not a mobile view web project.

Topics for this term (recommended):

Health (personal/mental/group)
Utility (personal or group-based)
Multi-device (watch/wearable/BLE)
Home Improvement
Environmental impact
Community-based/collaboration

Hardware IS an option! If you find some hardware you would like to integrate or take advantage of for a specific user or market, let me know so I can try to get it for you.
